# Synthwave 84 Powerpack Theme

Here is an [Alfred Powerpack Theme](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/appearance/) based on [Synthwave '84](https://robbowen.digital/wrote-about/synthwave-84/), an experimental Visual Studio theme influenced "by the music and the cover artwork of modern Synthwave bands like FM-84, Timecop 1983 and The Midnight".
